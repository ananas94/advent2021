Learning rust basics with https://adventofcode.com/

Some notes about how it's going:

Rust is not best choise for this type of work.

If my goal would be solve tasks as fast as possible - it would be something with REPL(node or python).

Main problem so far(day8) is parsing input and transforming types. Well.. it describes almost all programming.


TODO:

- ~~ day3_2: pass function as argument instead of two different functions, that differ only by filter ~~
- day7_1: look for some formal proof about median idea
- day7_2: look for some formal proof about average idea and why answer is average-1
