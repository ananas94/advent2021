Learning rust basics with https://adventofcode.com/

Some notes about how it's going:

Rust is not best choise for this type of work.

If my goal would be solve tasks as fast as possible - it would be something with REPL(node or python).

Main problem so far(day8) is parsing input and transforming types. Well.. it describes almost all programming.

Well, it's day12 and I started fighting with borrow checker...

TODO:

CLEAN UP EVERYTHING:

make it readable!

merge \_1 and \_2 dirs into single solution

Probably, include solution texts to subdirs

- ~~day3_2: pass function as argument instead of two different functions, that differ only by filter~~
- day7_1: look for some formal proof about median idea
- day7_2: look for some formal proof about average idea and why answer is average-1
- day12_1: I defenetly lose fight to borrow checker. Pretty sure it's possible to convince it store &String in history instead of String (references instead of objects)
